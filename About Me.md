# About Me
Hello! My name is Nguyen Thanh Chuc. I am a junior at the National Economic University (NEU), majoring in Management Information System (MIS).

## How I Got Started in Data Analysis
I began my journey in data analytics through self-directed learning during my academic studies. Engaging with data in assignments and small-scale projects allowed me to observe how raw data is transformed into meaningful visualizations and analytical models. This hands-on experience not only enhanced my technical proficiency but also revealed the significant insights and narratives embedded within data. These experiences inspired me to explore the field further with a deeper, more analytical approach.

## What Intrigues Me Most About Data
What fascinates me most about data is its ability to tell stories through data storytelling. Raw and complex data can be transformed into meaningful narratives that reveal trends, explain behaviors, or even predict future outcomes in a visually compelling way. I am particularly intrigued by the process of converting intricate numbers into clear and persuasive insights, combining logical analysis with creative presentation. This aspect highlights the power of data as a tool for effective communication and informed decision-making.
